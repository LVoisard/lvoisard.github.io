Project: Enigma, a hybrid 3D shooter/tower defense where the player must shoot at oncoming waves of enemies, all while constructing walls to influence their movement path. Set at the gates of hell, the protagonist’s role is to prevent various monsters from slipping through the portal to the surface world. Final Project for my game dev class.
