Hello, I'm Laurent! I am a passionate developer and researcher currently pursuing a thesis-based Master's at Concordia University in Montréal (expected to graduate in May 2026). I focus mainly on real-time simulations and game development. My thesis explores the entity component system pattern, but my interests and hobbies don't stop there. I also enjoy diving in technically challenging projects, computer graphics, procedural generation techniques, and much more. If you would like to know more about me, or what I do, feel free to look around or send me an e-mail!
